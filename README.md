# What is this repo?
Here are a watered down version of dotfiles for tmux and nvim.

## Why are they here?
- mainly here so I can grab them when I remote into other machines.
- also here in case they are useful to others.

## Why is this README terse?
- unfortunately this is probably as verbose as this readme will get, but if you need help with anything related to the contents of this, please just reach out.

## Quickstart 

### Install nvim 
More [here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

#### For debian (most GCP machines)

##### Get the dependencies

###### gcc-10-base
```bash
wget http://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/g/gcc-10/gcc-10-base_10-20200411-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb
```

Install those
###### gcc-10-base
```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./gcc-10-base_10-20200411-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb
```

and for the rest
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

###### now the real thing
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-linux64.tar.gz
sudo rm -rf /opt/nvim
sudo tar -C /opt -xzf nvim-linux64.tar.gz
```

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/opt/nvim-linux64/bin"
```

and, for ease, set an alias in your .bashrc
```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
alias vi='nvim'
```

write and close and source your .bashrc
```vim
:wq
```

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```


###### get git 
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

######  get packer
```bash
sudo git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.config/nvim/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

In order to open vim and have it auto install the plugins, it needs to be able to run packer in the background.
However, packer is installed to loca/share by default, and that's owned by the root, not the user.
so, in order for it to be allowed to do what it needs to do, you need to change the ownership of the folder where packer is.
You can verify that it's not owned by you by doing:

```bash
ls -ld ~/.local/share/nvim/site
ls -ld ~/.config/nvim
```

So, go fix that by doing this
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.local/share/nvim
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.config/nvim
```

Now open vim


### Init the config dir

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/rossamurphy/dotfiles 
sudo mkdir ~/.config
sudo cp -a ~/dotfiles/.config/. ~/.config
```

### Set up Packer
```bash
cd ./.config/nvim/lua
sudo nvim
```

```vim
:Ex
# Go the packer.lua file and source it
:so
:PackerInstall
:PackerSync
```


## Optional

### Install pip for python 3 (to install and update pynvim)
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

### Install / update pynvim

For python 3
```bash
sudo pip3 install pynvim
sudo pip3 install --update pynvim
```



### Install ruby (neovim likes it)

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

Then add neovim support

```bash
sudo gem install neovim
```
