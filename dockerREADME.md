for just doing it the docker way

to build locally (build on an m1, for all platforms)
this uses docker buildx under the hood
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest --push .
```

to run the image in interactive mode (on an m1)
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash

```

### RECOMMENDED
or, just clone the repo on a linux box, and use vanilla docker build to build it 
```bash
docker build -t rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest .
```
if you're happy with the result, push it
```bash
docker push rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest
```
note before you do the above you'll need to have logged in
```bash
docker login
```

now if you want to pull your image and run it anywhere
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y containerd runc docker.io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
docker pull rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 3000-3100:3000-3100 -it --runtime=nvidia --gpus all --privileged --shm-size=10gb --name rmvm -v rmvm_volume:/root/rmvm_volume -v /:/root/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash
```

it's also useful to create a volume to attach to the container to persist data
```bash
docker volume create rm_volume
```

Now to use the image to run the container, you have a few options

### Run using normal docker run command

#### note here below are reunning the container in a privileged fashion with the host volume as the root

##### if you run with --rm , then when you stop the container (ctrl-d out of it) it will auto-delete
docker run --name rmvm -it --rm --privileged -v /:/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all --privileged --shm-size=10gb --name rmvm -v rmvm_volume:/root/rmvm_volume -v /:/root/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash

##### if you run without --rm , when you stop the container (ctrl-d out of it) it will remain (but you'll need to start it again)
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --runtime=nvidia --gpus all --privileged --shm-size=10gb --name rmvm -v rmvm_volume:/root/rmvm_volume -v /:/root/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash

note you can also ctrl-p and ctrl-q out of it to leave it running

### Run using docker-compose
N.B. running use docker-compose currently does not attach the GPUs

you can also use docker-compose to start your docker container in detached mode (here we are doing so with a volume attached)
so, do this instead of just running it (the docker-compose.yml is in this repo)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

you can see the container you just started with
```bash
docker container ls
```

and attach to it by
```bash
docker container attach rmvm
```

and tear it down (and remove it) by
```bash
docker-compose down
```

now you can see that you've completely torn down and removed the container, however,
you can easily use the image to start the container again
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker container attach rmvm
```

### RECOMMENDED (to run with NVIDIA drivers)
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --runtime=nvidia --gpus all --privileged --shm-size=10gb --name rmvm -v rmvm_volume:/root/rmvm_volume -v /:/root/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash

### to exit a container without killing it

```bash
ctrl-p ctrl-q
```
this will execute the "docker escape sequence" and will detach you from the container without tearing it down
this is great for if you want to leave your tmux sessions up and your processes running
you can always just re-attach later



### Setting up neovim plugins
N.B. the FIRST time you create a NEW container, you'll need to install your plugins 
there is a way this can happen automatically in the image but it seems to be more hassle than it's worth
so, run the below in the container:
```bash
nvim --noplugins -c "luafile /root/.config/nvim/plugin_setup.lua"
```

this will do the thing. and now you can open neovim as per normal

and then open neovim as normal
```bash
vi
```

if you keep getting asked for git creds
```bash
brew install gh
```
then
```bash
gh auth login
```
and paste in a token


### because PyCharm / another IDE won't do it for you..

to activate the poetry venv
note this will make the current process a "poetry" one.
```bash
poetry shell
```

to activate another vanilla venv
(shortcut mapped in Dockerfile)
this will leave the current process unchanged
```bash
venvactivate
```

to activate the venv in a way that does not fuck with tmux navigator
this will leave the current process unchanged
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Why does it matter what the process is?
because if you use ```poetry shell``` to activate the environment it messes up
the pane switching via tmux navigator because it fails to notice the process as
a vim process, and rather, sees it as a "poetry" process

therefore, it's better to just source the venv (so you don't get linter badness
where it can't find certain libraries), and leave the process as vim and not
let it be comandeered by poetry

### initial set up
```bash
# get the github client and authenticate it
brew install gh
gh auth login
# remember that you need to press 5 on load
# also remember the nvidia-smi and nvml are already installed by virtue of the docker image
# to check this you can do `nvidia-smi` and `ldconfig -p | grep libnvidia-ml`
brew install btop
# authorise the gcloud cli
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
# authorise the aws cli
cp -a rmvm_volume/creds/aws/ .aws/
# install vim plugins
nvim --noplugins -c "luafile /root/.config/nvim/plugin_setup.lua"
```

#### Docker config
and add this to the `config.json` in the ~/.docker/ directory on the box
"detachKeys": "ctrl-^"

this means that you can still do ctrl-p to select all (in vim), as you've
remapped the above as the escape sequence from the container rather than
ctrl-p,q which is the default.


### An example workflow
open up a tmux session
pop up windows top left, top right, and bottom
open the backend repo
then do source .venv/bin/activate
then do vi and open it up. this is now your editor.
jump to the right
do `poetry shell` and `ppp`
now you have a python console open to the right. you can slime send to this if you like
then on the bottom do what you need in the terminal
like ```source .venv/bin/activate``` and ```make raydebug``` for example 

if you get kms badness
```bash 
 gcloud auth application-default login
 ```

#### for skipping ci cd 
[skip actions]

#### after switching into a new directory, if you've already previous sourced a venv and it's still active
```bash
deactivate
```
now, you can ```poetry install``` as you were.


#### To run npm run dev on port x on the container, on the box, and still be able to access it from localhost on the machine you're running it on 
ssh -i <keypath> -L ${port}:localhost:${port} <user>@<host>
