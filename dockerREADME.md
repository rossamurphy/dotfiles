for just doing it the docker way

to build locally (build on an m1, for all platforms)
this uses docker buildx under the hood
```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest --push .
```

to run the image in interactive mode (on an m1)
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash
```

### RECOMMENDED
or, just clone the repo on a linux box, and use vanilla docker build to build it 
```bash
docker build -t rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest .
```
if you're happy with the result, push it
```bash
docker push rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest
```
note before you do the above you'll need to have logged in
```bash
docker login
```

now if you want to pull your image and run it anywhere
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y containerd runc docker.io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
docker pull rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest
```

it's also useful to create a volume to attach to the container to persist data
```bash
docker volume create rm_volume
```

Now to use the image to run the container, you have a few options

### Run using normal docker run command

#### note here below are reunning the container in a privileged fashion with the host volume as the root

##### if you run with --rm , then when you stop the container (ctrl-d out of it) it will auto-delete
docker run --name rmvm -it --rm --privileged -v /:/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash

##### if you run without --rm , when you stop the container (ctrl-d out of it) it will remain
docker run --name rmvm -it --rm --privileged -v /:/host rossamurphy/dotfilesimage:latest /bin/bash

### Run using docker-compose

you can also use docker-compose to start your docker container in detached mode (here we are doing so with a volume attached)
so, do this instead of just running it (the docker-compose.yml is in this repo)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

you can see the container you just started with
```bash
docker container ls
```

and attach to it by
```bash
docker container attach rmvm
```

and tear it down (and remove it) by
```bash
docker-compose down
```

now you can see that you've completely torn down and removed the container, however,
you can easily use the image to start the container again
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker container attach rmvm
```

### to exit a container without killing it

```bash
ctrl-p ctrl-q
```
this will execute the "docker escape sequence" and will detach you from the container without tearing it down
this is great for if you want to leave your tmux sessions up and your processes running
you can always just re-attach later



### Setting up neovim plugins
N.B. the FIRST time you create a NEW container, you'll need to install your plugins 
there is a way this can happen automatically in the image but it seems to be more hassle than it's worth
so, run the below in the container:
```bash
nvim --noplugins -c "luafile /root/.config/nvim/plugin_setup.lua"
```

this will do the thing. and now you can open neovim as per normal

and then open neovim as normal
```bash
vi
```

if you keep getting asked for git creds
```bash
brew install gh
```
then
```bash
gh auth login
```
and paste in a token



### because PyCharm / another IDE won't do it for you..
to activate the poetry venv
```bash
poetry shell
```
to activate another vanilla venv
(shortcut mapped in Dockerfile)
```bash
venvactivate
```
