" this below can be useful when starting out
" however, it messes up with some other stuff in vim
" like ctrl-i to go forward to where your cursor was, 
" after you have done ctrl-o
" once you get used to using << and >> in normal mode
" and ctrl-d and ctrl-t in insert mode, they are actually
" easier and better to use
" " tab to dent and de-dent like in Pycharm

" nnoremap <S-TAB> <<
" vnoremap <TAB> >gv
" vnoremap <S-TAB> <gv
" inoremap <S-Tab> <C-d>

" this, is actually a more minimalist helper for the tabbing
" elements of vim. This will allow you to select a paragraph 
" or block of code (vip for exmample), and then just continue tabbing it
" using the greater than or less than signs (because usually, without this,
" once you do one tab, it deselects the visual block, in which case you
" usually need to resort to using . or u to cycle through indentation levels).
