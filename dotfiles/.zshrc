# if you have not already pip installed ipython into THAT particular
# python venv, then, it will actually default to using a DIFFERENT env!
# a way to get around this, is to call ipy instead, aliased below
# this will make sure it tries to call ipython from the CURRENT environment
# if it doesn't work, it's because ipython is not installed in that
# environment. But, it's better for it to jank out and let you know this
# in advance, instead of just defaulting.
