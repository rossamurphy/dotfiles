# Yes, you COULD just straight up make the .config and vim stuff in the /host, and ignore the faff with volumes. but then your docker set up is just functioning as a Make file really. It's quite nice that everything is a container and everything can be torn down at the end of the day, leaving basically no trace on the host.
